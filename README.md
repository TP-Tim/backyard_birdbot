# bird_vision
## Introduction
This is a silly home project to use existing ML models to:
  1. Detect any birds sighted by a webcam
  2. Identify which species they belongs to
  3. Post images and descriptions of the detected birds to twitter ([@BackyardBirdbot](https://twitter.com/BackyardBirdbot))

This project was my first Python project, so my main goal was to learn more about Python through experience. The main code is contained with in bird_detect.py.
